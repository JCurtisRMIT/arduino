## Getting Started With Arduino
The Arduino name describes both a specific piece of hardware - an open-source microprocessor development board invented by the Italian company Arduino (Links to an external site.) - and an ecosystem for design, development, learning and making. Arduino is an important platform in the field of Design because it gives easy access to the tools and resources need for electronic prototyping. Arduino was specifically designed to allow people with no previous experience in electronics to build interactive objects and environments.

Because Arduino is an open source platform, a great number of third party boards are available. Some of these boards are direct replicas of the official Arduino boards, others offer additional features, reduced size or significantly reduced cost. Instructions or code written for the Arduino are termed Sketches and are generally uploaded to the Arduino board over a USB cable. Most Arduino and Arduino compatible boards use the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and upload instructions to the microprocessor on the board. The Arduino IDE software is open source and can be downloaded from www.arduino.cc (Links to an external site.) for free.

 

### Hello World using "Blink"
Running the "blink" sketch is the perfect way to test out communications an Arduino that you have bought or borrowed. It's a good habit to try this first whenever you get a new Arduino. "Blink" is one of the many examples that comes packed in with the Arduino IDE. Make sure to explore more of the examples too.

Getting Started:

* Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* if you are running Windows on your computer you may need to install drivers for the Arduino.
* See details on the Arduino [getting started](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) page.
* Open the Arduino application
* Connect the Arduino board to the computer via the USB cable
* Select the board type under the tools menu
* Select the serial port
* Open the blink sketch from the examples
* Upload the sketch to the Arduino
* Watch the light on the Arduino blink
* Play with the sketch: change values in the **delay()** function
