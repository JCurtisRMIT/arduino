We've explored Blynk in a previous module with Particle. This time we're going to use Blynk with a regular Arduino and also using a nice and easy board containing an ESP8266 wifi module.\

\f1\b\fs28 \cf3 Getting Set up with Blynk\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf3 Firstly we're going to need to download the Blynk app for either Android or iPhone, it's a free download.\
Once it's finished downloading, open up the app and create an account. Now, install the Blynk library using your Arduino IDE. We'll need it in a minute.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \'a0\
Now there are a few ways to use Blynk. Blynk needs to connect to your Arduino (or other MCU) via the internet. There are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://github.com/blynkkk/blynkkk.github.io/blob/master/SupportedHardware.md"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 many}} supported hardware platforms that you can use with Blynk (about 400!) however we're only going to cover two here. For a regular Arduino with no wifi module you can install some software that will allow your Arduino to use a USB connection to your computer to connect to the internet.\'a0\
As a more portable alternative, there is a nice and easy to use series of wifi enabled Arduino compatible boards that all use a microchip called the ESP8266. For this module we'll be using this one, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jaycar.com.au/wifi-mini-esp8266-main-board/p/XC3802"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 D1 Mini}}.\'a0\
There are many other ESP8266 variants that can work with Blynk, so if you're comfortable reading the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.blynk.cc/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 documentation}} yourself go ahead and grab any one you like.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 What's great about the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jaycar.com.au/wifi-mini-esp8266-main-board/p/XC3802"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 D1 Mini}} is that it has 11 GPIO pins on board and can run Arduino sketches. These pins are 3.3v logic level, but you can supply 5v to it (from USB or to the 5v pin) and the onboard regulator will safely supply the board with 3.3v. We're going to need to install a couple of things to get up and running first.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f1\b \cf3 Serial drivers: 
\f0\b0 The D1 Mini uses a CH340G USB-Serial IC- drivers for this can be downloaded from the IC\uc0\u8232 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.wch.cn/download/CH341SER_ZIP.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 manufacturer\'92s website}}. You may already have this installed if you've used an Arduino Nano with a CH340G chip on board.\

\f1\b Arduino IDE Boards Manager: 
\f0\b0 To use with the Arduino IDE, it is recommended to use version 1.6.4 or later so that the Boards\uc0\u8232 Manager can handle the installation. To install board support for ESP8266, in\u8232 File>Preferences>Additional Board Manager URLS add:

\f0 \cf3 \'a0\
You'll see a couple of lines in the code that you'll need to change to get up and running. Firstly is your "Auth Token". This is the token that is generated in each project you make on Blynk.\
Let's make a new project on our Blynk app. Then press the 'nut' icon to see Project Settings.\
Under "Devices" add a new device and select 
\f1\b WeMos D1 mini\'a0
\f0\b0 with Connection Type 
\f1\b WiFi
\f0\b0 . You'll see your 
\f1\b Auth Token
\f0\b0  below. You can use the top field to name your device whatever you'd like.\
If you don't feel like manually typing that really long string of characters and numbers you can have Blynk email you the Auth token using the Email button. Copy the token into line 34 of the Arduino code between the quotes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf3 char auth[] = "YourAuthToken";\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf3 \'a0\
Now copy your WiFi SSID and Password into the following lines of the Arduino sketch. Your WiFi SSID is the name of your WiFi when you connect to it. Make sure to keep the quotes.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0

\f3 \cf3 char ssid[] = "YourNetworkName";\
char pass[] = "YourPassword";\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0 \cf3 \'a0\
Now save your sketch and run it. Open up the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE at 9600 baud and watch as your new D1 mini connects to the internet using your WiFi, it may take a second or two.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \'a0\
If you see a similar screen in your Serial Monitor you've successfully connected to Blynk! Take a look in your app and press the "Play" button in the top right hand corner. After you've done this, if you tap the icon next to it (that looks like an Arduino Uno)\'a0 you'll be able to see that your device you named earlier is now Online.\
Great, now lets explore simple connections between your phone and Blynk.\

\f0\b0\fs24 \cf3 First let's make a simple circuit with an LED and a resistor. Make sure you unplug your D1 Mini when changing the circuit. It's bad practice to leave a circuit powered whilst changing connections.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 Now in the Blynk app, ensure you project isn't running using the 
\f1\b Stop
\f0\b0  button in the top right hand corner. Tap your finger in the project space grid to open the 
\f1\b Widget box
\f0\b0 . Here you can select all sorts of widgets to use in your project. Take note of any that you may want to use later.\
Select 
\f1\b Button
\f0\b0  and it will now appear in your project. You can tap the 
\f1\b Button
\f0\b0  widget in your project to change its settings.\'a0\
We're going to tap the 
\f1\b Output
\f0\b0  section and change the Pin to 
\f1\b Digital Pin: D1
\f0\b0 \

\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf3 \'a0\
Now close the 
\f1\b Button Settings
\f0\b0  menu by hitting OK. Go ahead and plug your 
\f1\b D1 Mini
\f0\b0  into power, check the 
\f1\b Serial Monitor
\f0\b0  again to see that it connects successfully to your WiFi. Once it has, you can hit 
\f1\b Play
\f0\b0  now in your project and try tapping the button on the Blynk app.\
Voila! Notice how we didn't need to write any code in the Arduino IDE for 
\f1\b pinMode()
\f0\b0  and 
\f1\b digitalWrite()
\f0\b0  like usual? The Blynk library takes care of some of this stuff so we can prototype some functionality just using the app.\

\f1\b \cf2 \ul \ulc2 \strokec2 Virtual Pins}}.\'a0 Virtual Pins allow you to send data to and from the app in a way that the app can understand. It's important to note that Virtual Pins are 
\f2\i in addition to
\f0\i0  the Digital Pins you have on your board, hence Virtual. Think of these pins as the information handlers between the Widgets in your project and your board. Virtual Pins can also be used to interface with external libraries (Servo, LCD and others) and implement custom functionality.\

Take care to read the comments in all of the new parts of the code. We have some basic logic for flipping the state of the button, a custom function called 
\f1\b buttonLEDWidget()\'a0
\f0\b0 which is attached to a 
\f1\b timer\'a0
\f0\b0 and a new type of data structure 
\f1\b WidgetLED
\f0\b0  which we've attached to the variable 
\f1\b led1 
\f0\b0 set to Virtual Pin 0
\f1\b  (V0
\f0\b0 )\
Every half second, the sketch will check to see if the state of the button has changed. If it has, we're calling 
\f1\b led1.on()\'a0
\f0\b0 - else we're turning the 
\f1\b led1.off()
\f0\b0 \
Let's see it in action. In your Blynk project, delete the 
\f1\b Button
\f0\b0  from the last section and add an 
\f1\b LED
\f0\b0  Widget from the 
\f1\b Displays
\f0\b0  section. You can resize it in the project space too, make it nice and big.\
Now tap the 
\f1\b LED
\f0\b0  Widget and enter the 
\f1\b LED Widget Settings
\f0\b0  page. We're going to change the 
\f1\b INPUT\'a0
\f0\b0 to 
\f1\b V0.\'a0
\f0\b0 Notice that you can only use Virtual Pins here? As mentioned above, the Virtual Pins act as a "middleman" between your board's code and the Widgets in your app. In most cases you'll need a Virtual Pin to make changes like this.\
