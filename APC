# Conductive Tattoo Atari Punk Console

In this section we're going to make a very simple synthesiser circuit known by some as the "atari punk console". This circuit was originally created by Forrest Mims III and published in his book "Engineer's Mini-Notebook - 555 Circuits" as the "Stepped Tone Generator". 

The 555 timer integrated circuit is simple and effective for creating oscillations, which is why it forms the basis for this synthesiser circuit. We'll actually be using a NE556, which contains two 555 timers in the one IC package.
