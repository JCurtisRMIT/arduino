# Conductive Tattoo Atari Punk Console

In this section we're going to make a very simple synthesiser circuit known by some as the "atari punk console". This circuit was originally created by Forrest Mims III and published in his book "Engineer's Mini-Notebook - 555 Circuits" as the "Stepped Tone Generator". 

The 555 timer integrated circuit is simple and effective for creating oscillations, which is why it forms the basis for this synthesiser circuit. For simplicity we'll actually be using a NE556, which actually just contains two 555 timers in the one IC package.

Typically these tone generators are controlled by two potentiometers or photoresistors. This time we'll experiment with conductive paint.

First, create a long trace of conductive paint on some paper (the longer and thinner the better). Experiment in branching traces off and use different line thicknesses. 

To ensure a long trace you can curl the line back around to create patterns (so long as it doesn't connect with itself).
